Grind garlic, ginger, and green chillies to a smooth paste. Add little water to make the process easier.

Soak basmati rice in water for half an hour and set aside.
Heat some oil in another pan and fry 1/4 cup sliced onions, 13 cashew nuts and raisins separately. Set aside.
To prepare rice for the biriyani:-
Heat 2 tbsp ghee in a deep pan and splutter fennel seeds. Fry one medium onion until translucent. Add cloves, cardamom pods, cinnamon stick and bay leaves. Fry again. Add 8 cups of water along with 3 cups of washed rice. Add lemon juice. Season with salt. Let it come to boil. Then turn down the heat and cover the pan with a lid. Once cooked, drain and keep it aside.
To prepare gravy for chicken:-
Heat oil in a pan and fry the rest of onions until golden brown. Then add remaining paste and fry for a few seconds. Throw in tomatoes, the rest of the spices ( ground coriander, ground red chilies, ground black pepper, garam masala), enough salt and cashew nut paste. Fry again for 3-4 minutes. Add chicken pieces along with 1/3 cup water. Finally, add 2 tsp yogurt and 1 tsp vinegar. Cook again for a couple of minutes.
To arrange the layers :-
Take a deep heavy bottomed pan and place a layer of chicken. Then add a layer of rice. Pour 1/2 tsp rose water. Use chicken and rice alternatively until finished. But make sure the top layer is rice. Pour 1/2 tsp rose water. Add 1 tbsp ghee.
Now you can garnish biryani with fried cashew nuts, raisins, onions and chopped coriander leaves.
To 'dum' biryani, place the pan on a large tawa over low heat for 10 minutes.
